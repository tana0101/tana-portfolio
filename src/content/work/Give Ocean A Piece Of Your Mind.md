#### Key Features

1.  **Underwater Image Restoration**: WaterNet, using weights trained on the provided dataset by the author.

2.  **Automatic Colorization**: neural-colorization, original weights provided by the author, and weights trained by us.

3.  **Load Images, Videos, and Web Camera Feeds**: Supports multimedia usage.

4.  **Image Slider Comparison**: Provides a more convenient and intuitive way to compare images.

5.  **Object Recognition**: YOLO v8, official original weights and weights trained for fish and colorblock recognition.

6.  **Colorblock Capture and Analysis**: Manually captures colorblocks to evaluate colorblock data in images.
